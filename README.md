## Hello, this is Arnav Rawat's github

I am Arnav Rawat, a software developer interested in applying analysis and mathematics to a variety of problem domains, including

- Artificial Intelligence, Statistics and and how I can convey the insights from their usage through visualization
  - Agents, memory banks and vector databases
- Linux development: familiar with the networking and process management stack (NetworkManager & SystemD), as well as software development process
  - Familiar with some kernel technologies, such as bpf and device driver subsystems
  - Linux desktop user (see my setup)
- Embedded development, including application of DSP principles: Fourier Transforms, Filtering; Control Theory, including PID control and tuning, formulation of system transfer functions
  - Experienced in Qt GUI framework through open-source contributions to the KDE software project
- Frontend: React, MUI
- Adept in SQL, database locking protocols and related performance considerations

### Other Pursuits

I am passionate about Mathematics; despite its abstract nature, it brings me joy to be able to visualize arguments, apply intuition and creativity to find proofs and counterexamples. I am currently reading about two areas that have captured my attention, Complex Analysis (Conway) and Probability (Billingsley). Also in the vein of mathematics, I am learning more about numerically solving Partial Differential Equations and parallelizing those solutions with OpenMP and MPI.

I enjoy rock climbing and biking.
